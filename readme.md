# Kaltura Node-JS Template
All the necessary components, and some nice-to-haves to get a node.js app running with the Kaltura  API.

# Summary
 This project is a proof of concept to show you how to programmatically use a recording created from a Kaltura Meeting. The meeting can be run in an ad-hoc, on the fly manner and a recording of the meeting will be available for playback.

# How to Run
1. Copy env.template to .env and fill in your information
2. run npm install
3. npm run dev for developement
4. npm start for production

# Documentation

This project consists of two components: 

1. Starting a Kaltura meeting and recording it
2. Finding the recording and playing it back

To start a meeting, the code from [kaltura-nodejs-template](https://github.com/kaltura-vpaas/kaltura-nodejs-template)  was copied into this project, and you can refer to [Kaltura Meetings Integration Guide](https://github.com/kaltura-vpaas/virtual-meeting-rooms ) for a comprehensive guide to the Meetings API. 

First a form is created to gather all necessary information to start a live meeting. The example use-case would be a student that wants to ask a question to a teacher, so a field for question is provided in
